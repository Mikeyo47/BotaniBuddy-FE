# BotaniBuddy-FE

This is a group project created by students at Northcoders. The project idea and tech stack was decided by the group and had to include two new technologies, which we didn't cover during the bootcamp (in our case MongoDB and ReactNative). 

The application is a mobile app that allows a user to identify their plants using image recognition technology and add them to 'their garden'. It then includes reminders to water the plants they own. 

The APIs used are: 
* https://perenual.com/docs/api
* https://my.plantnet.org/
